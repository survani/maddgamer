Warzone 2.0 season 2 is coming in the next few weeks, and hopefully, things like this do not happen to many of you again.

[**Warzone2News**](https://twitter.com/Warzone2News) tweeted about a clip of u/ForeverInBlueJeanz where he dies in the airplane before even leaving it. Yes, it is funny at first, but many are complaining that the game is unplayable at times. What do you think?

Personally I have never expierience something like this, but it is set to cause fustration among players. Check out the clip below.
