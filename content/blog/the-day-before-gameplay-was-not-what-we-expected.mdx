#### Better Late Than Never

[The Day Before](https://www.fntastic.com/) has been doubted by many to be a real video game. Fntastic Games assured us that there would be gameplay revealing happening anytime now. Even if the gameplay reveal was slightly behind schedule they managed to give us what they promised.

If you decided to watch the video before reading this article you already know what went down. You may have your impressions of the reveal. We will try to explain why we think the reveal was not as great as we hoped.

#### The Beganning of the Reveal

Frankly, the very start of the reveal showcased a pleasant view of the world. It wasn't out of this world, but it was not bad either.

You start as a generic female character walking down what seems to be a neighborhood. Ambient sound gives us a sense of peace instead of fear of the dead. The female character enters a house where it starts playing some sort of elevator music...Hmm? Interesting doesn't fit the game genre in my opinion. I was hoping for some more suspenseful music to set the tone.

At this point, you are given a view of some UI aspects of the game as she spends an enormous time at what seems to be a crafting table. I liked the minimalistic UI. They really shouldn't have spent so long showcasing this section of the game as it seems to be so generic.

Why not spend more time showcasing action-packed content. Something to leave us on the edge.

#### Boring Zombies...

Yes, they showcased the zombies of the game. We were very disappointed with those boring zombies. At minute 3:43 of the video, you can see the female character shooting some of them down. What was weird is that the zombies were not even chasing them. No sort of interaction with the Zombies they were just standing there.

#### The Rest of the Gameplay was a walking simulator

We expected more of a finished game, but we will just have to wait to see if they make more improvements to the game to keep players hooked. To end this we would like to speak of the short 39-second video of someone we don't know who he is playing **The Day Before**. Why was this needed? They didn't showcase anything too new. The same environment, just a different character model.
