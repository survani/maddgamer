#### - The Next Big Thing

Turtle Rock Studios is saying goodbye to Back 4 Blood! No this does not mean the game is shutting down, but it won't have new content. **[Turtle Rock Studios](https://turtlerockstudios.com/news/b4b-2223)** stated the following:

> Turtle Rock Studios is actually pretty small for a studio making AAA games. We don’t have quite enough folks to continue working on Back 4 Blood content while we spin up another game – yes, another game! Given this, it’s time for us to put our heads down, get back in the lab, and get to work on the next big thing.

As we mentioned before Back 4 Blood will continue to operate the same. If you are looking to jump into the game and you are a PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium member you can download the game for free. Xbox Game Pass holders can also download the game for free.

#### - Turtle Rock Studios Doesn't Join The Closure Trend

We are happy to know that **Back 4 Blood** won't be joining all those shooter games halting their live services. Even with the game not bringing anymore content to the table they did released a good amount of expansions leaving the game in a great state to play.

We will continue to keep an eye out for **Turtle Rock Studios** new game!
