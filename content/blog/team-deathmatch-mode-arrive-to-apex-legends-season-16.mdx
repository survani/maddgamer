**Apex Legends** Season 16 is heading our way and a few things will be coming to Apex Legends like Team Deathmatch a well-beloved game mode for many.

Team Deathmatch game mode will arrive with **Revelry** and will act like the usual Team Deathmatch in other games.

- Six player teams
- Respawns are fast
- 30 kill game point
- Two-Round game

We will be doing a review of Season 16 the following day of its release date. We hope with these additions we will be seeing a large number of players in the game.
