#### Its Becoming a Trend This Year

The year 2023 has come with many service closures of shooter games ranging from; _Apex Legends Mobile_, _Medal of Honor_, _Medal of Honor: Airborne_, _Medal of Honor: Warfigter_, and many more.

Now CrossfireX joins the list. Developers **Smilegate** announced that its year-old multiplayer shooter will be shutting down on **May 18th**. They lack a real explanation of why they were doing it. Mentioning that

> ...the game was ultimately not where it needed to be" as the main reason.

They did hit a few key points regarding what will happen to CrossfireX before the closure. Let us explore those key points:

- If you made Purchases within the last 14 days as of February 3, 2023, may claim a refund
- Single-player campaigns will not be playable after May 18th
- No longer be able to purchase CFP/GP which are the game currency
- If you still have the in-game currency you can spend it until the closure of the game
